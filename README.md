# GTMP Download Guide (Old, go to https://github.com/the-bl-heretic/gif-to-mp/wiki for updated version)

## Step 1 Download
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/the-bl-heretic/gif-to-mp)

## Step 2 Drag & Drop
Drop the "Scripts" and "Editor" to the assets folder

## Step 3 Initilization
After the scripts finish compiling, you will notice a new option in the tool bar; Click it.
Go to settings and then choose your desired options.
Then press "Add Componment" on any object with a "Mesh Renderer" and search "Gif" Just press the first option.

## Step 4 Using The Script
Drag and drop your desired GIF into the assets folder. If you see a duplicate file but with ".bytes" at the end. Don't delete it.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/767f4f66-e5ea-480c-8121-b43c3440d027)
# Drop the new file into the "GIF Asset" Slot in the script.
If there is no duped file. Right click on your GIF and then press Re-Import and then a new file should appear. If not, you **have** done something wrong in the setup, maybe a missing file/folder? Maybe a file where it shouldn't be?
